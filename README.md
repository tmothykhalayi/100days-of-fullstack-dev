10-Day Recap: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript
This document serves as a README for my 10-day recap on fundamental web manipulation concepts, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. It outlines the key topics covered and provides insights into the practical applications of these technologies.

Topics Covered:
HTML Basics

Overview of web page structure.

Key tags and semantic elements (<header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, etc.).

Best practices for clean, accessible, and SEO-friendly HTML.

CSS Fundamentals

Introduction to selectors, properties, and values.

Styling text, colors, background, and borders.

Layout techniques: Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries for responsive design.

Understanding the box model, margins, padding, and positioning.

JavaScript Essentials

Variables and data types: let, const, var, arrays, and objects.

DOM manipulation: selecting elements, changing text, styles, and attributes.

Event handling with addEventListener for interactivity (click, hover, form submit).

Functions, loops, and control flow statements (if/else, for, while).

TypeScript Essentials

Introduction to TypeScript and how it enhances JavaScript.

Static typing: declaring types for variables, function parameters, and return types.

Using interfaces and classes for better structure and scalability in projects.

Type assertions and TypeScript’s error-checking during development.

Integrating TypeScript with existing JavaScript code.

Practical Applications:
Building static web pages with HTML and CSS, such as a personal webpage or a landing page.

Creating responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid for adaptive designs.

Adding JavaScript interactivity, like form validation, toggling visibility, and handling user input dynamically.

TypeScript integration: Rewriting JavaScript code in TypeScript for added type safety and debugging features, especially in larger applications.
Goals:
By the end of this recap, I aim to:
Strengthen my understanding of core web development concepts, including TypeScript.

Build projects such as a portfolio page or simple web app to showcase these skills.

Prepare for more advanced topics in full-stack development, including backend technologies and frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and Angular, where TypeScript is commonly used.

Additional Notes on TypeScript:
TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which can help prevent bugs and make large-scale development more manageable. By defining explicit types for variables, function parameters, and return values, TypeScript can catch errors at compile time, making it easier to debug and scale projects.

Types: Use of primitive types like string, number, boolean, any, void, and unknown.

Interfaces: Defining custom structures for objects to enforce a specific shape or contract.

Classes and Inheritance: Writing OOP-style code with TypeScript’s class, extends, and implements keywords.

Modules: Using import and export to modularize code in TypeScript.
